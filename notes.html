            <ul>
                <li>Hydroelectric power is a form of renewable energy that creates energy using kinetic energy from flowing water (or waterfall) Typically involving machinery like a dam or water reservoir. </li>
                <li>The dam is positioned on a downhill source of flowing water where they use a turbine that uses the flowing water to spin and send electricity through a power grid.</li>
                <li>Advantages- Hydropower provides flood control, Hydropower provides low carbon footprint, and Hydropower is flexible and quick to power.</li>
                <li>Disadvantages-Can harm/alter natural habitats around it, Changing water cycles can affect power output, Disputes over water rights are slowing dam production</li>
                <li>Locations in the US that use hydroelectric energy are the following: Grand Coulee dam-Washington, Hoover dam- Nevada, Bath County pumped storage station- Virginia. </li>
                <li>Energy from moving water can be used to create electricity in several different ways a hydroelectric dam, wave power, or tidal power. Hydroelectric dams take energy from moving rivers. The dam controls the flow of water and the amount of electricity that is produced. Dams create large bodies of calm water (or reservoirs) </li>
