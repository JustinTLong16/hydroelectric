        <h2>What is Hydroelectricty</h2>
        <p>
            Hydroelectric power is a form of renewable energy that generates electricity by utilizing the kinetic energy of flowing or 
            falling water. This process typically involves a dam or a water reservoir that captures water from rivers. As water flows 
            through turbines, it spins them, converting the water's energy into mechanical energy, which is then transformed into 
            electrical energy through generators. Hydroelectric power is considered a clean energy source because it produces little to 
            no greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels.

        <h2>How Does Moving Water Get Turned Into Electricity</h2>
        <p>
            The dam is positioned on a downhill source of flowing water where they use a turbine to take advantage of the flowing water 
            to spin the turbine and send the generated electricity through a power grid to be used as needed.  The water flows from the 
            penstock to the turbine and then to the outside outlet so that it can keep flowing
