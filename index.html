                <h2>What is Hydroelectricty</h2>
                <p>
                    Hydroelectric power is a form of renewable energy that generates electricity by utilizing the kinetic energy of flowing or 
                    falling water. This process typically involves a dam or a water reservoir that captures water from rivers. As water flows 
                    through turbines, it spins them, converting the water's energy into mechanical energy, which is then transformed into 
                    electrical energy through generators. Hydroelectric power is considered a clean energy source because it produces little to 
                    no greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels.

                <h2>How Does Moving Water Get Turned Into Electricity</h2>
                <p>
                    The dam is positioned on a downhill source of flowing water where they use a turbine to take advantage of the flowing water 
                    to spin the turbine and send the generated electricity through a power grid to be used as needed.  The water flows from the 
                    penstock to the turbine and then to the outside outlet so that it can keep flowing

                <h2>Can anything be done to use the power of moving water to create electricity?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yes, energy from moving water can be used to create electricity in several different ways a hydroelectric dam, wave power, or tidal power. Hydroelectric dams 
                    take energy from moving rivers. The dam controls the flow of water and the amount of electricity that is produced. Dams create large bodies of calm water 
                    (or reservoirs) behind them. These bodies of water can be used for recreation, wildlife sanctuaries, or even sources of drinking water. Wave power takes energy 
                    from waves on the surface of the ocean using technology like a special buoy or other floating device. Tidal power takes energy from flowing waters with the help
                    of turbines as tides rush in and out of coastal areas.
